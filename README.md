## ‚òùÔ∏è That's Clive
He's a very simple bot that monitors Twitch chat for clips and auto-posts them to Discord. He runs on a diet of [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [tmi.js](https://docs.tmijs.org/v1.2.1/index.html). He needs to live on a server (Like an [Amazon EC2 instance](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/tutorials/launch-a-virtual-machine/)). I use a [Pocket C.H.I.P.](https://getchip.com/pages/pocketchip) to host Clive.

**Some assembly required (it helps to be familiar with node).**

## ü§ñ Instructions (OSX/Linux/Windows)
Before starting, make sure [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) v8.9.0 or later is installed. You will also need a [webhook](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks) for the Discord channel where these clips will be posted.

1. Open terminal.
2. Navigate to a directory (like `~/Developer`).
3. Run `git clone https://github.com/mangosango/Clive.git && cd Clive`.
4. Run `npm install`
5. Copy `.env-exmaple` to `.env`*
6. Open `.env` in a text editor (like [atom](https://atom.io/)).
7. Adjust `NODE_ENV` and `LOG_LEVEL` for your use case
7. Set `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` to your [Discord webhook URL](http://i.imgur.com/sEUCxct.png) between the quotes.*
8. Set `TWITCH_CHANNELS` to your Twitch channel. For example, if you wanted to watch for clips in `Monstercat`'s chat, you would use `"monstercat"`. If you wanted to monitor multiple channels, you would use `"monstercat mrchowderclam updownleftdie"`.
9. (Optional, recommended) Set `TWITCH_CLIENT_ID` to have your Twitch API Client ID [Twitch Dev Getting Started](https://dev.twitch.tv/get-started)
10. Save `.env`.
11. In terminal, run `npm start`.
12. ???
13. Profit.

\* **.env file is primarly for development and debugging.** Environment variables are perfered for production environment.
*To use environment variables, you can set `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` and `TWITCH_CHANNELS`. `TWITCH_CHANNELS` should be a space limited set of `channel_name`s. You can set these in the provided `clive.service` file, or by using the `export` command. Here's a [short guide](http://blog.mdda.net/oss/2015/02/16/forever-node-service-systemd). on how to use systemd.*

## üìã Todo
- Option to only send clips of a certain channel or channels.
- ~~Option to only send clips posted by broadcaster, mods, or subs.~~
- ~~Set the `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` to pull from an evar or something.~~
- Having a UI or hosting this somewhere would be nice.
- Make clive an actual Discord bot, but that would require actual work lol.
- ~~MFW the Readme is bigger than the app LUL~~
